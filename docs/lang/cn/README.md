# Welcome to the Alief Document!

### Introduction

Alief focused on creating an efficient and reliable blockchain solution based on Substrate framework. As a new generation of decentralized financial infrastructure protocol platform, Alief provides basic operations and chain contract examples for a variety of financial products and services.

### Implementation

The implementation of Alief will be divided into 4 stages. Fist, Alief will work as Relay Chain to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem. It will enable decentralized exchange to support multiple cross-chain assets. The next stage, Alief is going to issue a stablecoin on Alief chain. Then, Alief will develop the decentralized financial service protocol. The last stage will be aimed at developing more sophisticated financial services based on decentralized protocol such as contract, insurance and asset management.
